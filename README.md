# Welcome my name is Cecilia and this is my full-stack software engineering portfolio. Designed with bootstrap.

## I am adding new and more complex HTML, CSS, and Javascript projects.

## Project descriptions: 
### Financial dashboard app: Built with Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and Vercel Postgres SDK (software development kit). It is my Capstone project for MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding that I got an exemplary badge on. Retreived data using APIs and SQL. Implemented dynamic rendering, search and pagination using URL search parameters, and authentication and authorization. Deployed on Vercel for the ability to view live code.
