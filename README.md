# Welcome my name is Cecilia and this is my full-stack software engineering portfolio. Developed with React, Next.js, TailwindCSS Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## I am adding new and more complex HTML, CSS, and Javascript projects.

## How to start a react app
### In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### Runs the app in the development mode.\
### Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### The page will reload when you make changes.\
### You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

### Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
### See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/### running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

### Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
### It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
### Your app is ready to be deployed!


## Project descriptions: 
### Financial dashboard app: Built with Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, and Vercel Postgres SDK (software development kit). It is my Capstone project for MITxPRO Professional Certificate in Coding that I got an exemplary badge on. Retreived data using APIs and SQL. Implemented dynamic rendering, search and pagination using URL search parameters, and authentication and authorization. Deployed on Vercel for the ability to view live code.
