                    I am a creative web developer with a passion for creating appealing and
                    functional websites. My journey in web development started with a simple
                    <span className="italic"> 'Hello world'</span> HTML page. Since then, I have 
                    sharpened my skills in HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript and Python, and I am always eager to learn more. ðŸŒ±
