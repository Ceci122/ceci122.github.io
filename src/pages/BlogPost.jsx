                <h1>My Journey to Becoming a Software Engineer</h1>
                <p>
                    Transitioning from IT Professional to Software Engineer has been a challenging yet rewarding journey.
                    It all started with a desire to create something more than just maintaining systems and networks.
                    I wanted to build applications that could solve real-world problems and make a difference.

                    I knew I wanted to upgrade from my (almost embarrassing) basic GitHub portfolio.
                    Plus, it would be awesome to be able to see my growth and be able to showcase that
                    in hopes to, I dunno, maybe inspire others like me. Transitioning from being an <em>
                    IT Professional</em> (and feeling stuck in it) to Software Engineer felt scary
                    but in a good way. In a way that both challenged me and gave me motivation to learn.
                    I had always been interested in designing apps and web sites. Ever since I created my Tumblr.
                    That motivation and curiosity has motivated me to keep going no matter how overwhelming
                    or scary it felt.

                <h2>The How?</h2>
                <p>
                    So I knew I had to start with the basics. Which framework and library was I going to use?
                    Which plugin? Which theme? How was the file tree structure going to look like? Is it going
                    to be SPA, like most Web Devs do, and all that good jazz. But no I wanted to be different
                    I want to create a hybrid of both SPA and multi-page (React routing).
